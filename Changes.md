# Version 1.1
* The authors' and editors' list has been changed. Prior to this version the package file contained one dc:creator entry with the concatenated list of editors or authors stored as a single string. This has been changed to a proper listing of dc:creator entries in the metadata (using a @role attribute value). The listing on the various other pages (like the cover page) has been adapted to use this setup. This change relies on the change from 1.3 to 1.4 for rp2epub.
* The documentation is also generated in epub...

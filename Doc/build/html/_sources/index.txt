Respec Collection to EPUB
=========================

Combine several HTML EPUB documents generated by the separate `rp2epub <https://github.com/iherman/respec2epub>`__ utility into one document.
This utility is useful when a generic W3C technology consists of several, interrelated documents, each defining a Recommendation of a W3C Note.

The utility is a thin layer on top of the `Respec to EPUB Utility <https://github.com/iherman/respec2epub>`__. It can take, as input, either
EPUB files, or unpacked versions thereof, and combine these into one EPUB file. Details of the combination are specificied in a separate
(JSON) configuration file.

The package is **not** a generic HTML➝EPUB 3 solution.

The package can be used through a command line tool (see the manual below) or can be the core of a separate Web Service.

For developers
--------------

When used from within Python, the “entry point” or the package is the :py:func:`.rp2book.start` function
method thereof. A typical usage is::

    from rp2book import start
    start(json_conf, package=..., folder=...)


Dependencies
------------

The package relies on Python 2.7. The script does not work (yet?) with Python 3; the underlying HTML library
(e.g., HTML5Lib) seems to have issues with encoding, UTF-8, etc.

Apart from the standard Python libraries the package depends on

* `rp2epub <https://github.com/iherman/respec2epub>`__, the ReSpec to EPUB utility. Note that this dependency is not only based on the fact that the layer takes the input generated by that output, but the some modules are also directly imported.
* `PyYAML <http://pyyaml.org/>`__, the YAML parser, used for the configuration file (if YAML is used). Note that this module is important only if a YAML is found; if all configurations are strictly in JSON, the installation of this package is not necessary.

Indirectly, the package also depends (through the dependency in `rp2epub <https://github.com/iherman/respec2epub>`__) on

* `HTML5lib <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/html5lib>`__, an HTML5 parser library for Python. This package has been tested with version 0.999999 of that library; earlier versions had Unicode encoding issues, and should not be used.
* `Tiny CSS <https://pythonhosted.org/tinycss/>`__, a simple CSS parser. This package has been tested with version 0.3.

<span style="font-size: 120%">_**This project is now archived and will not maintained any more. In particular, I do not plan to change the project to make it Python 3 compatible. A replacement for the ReSpec->EPUB has been developed in TypeScript called [`rs2epub`](https://github.com/iherman/rs2epub) (built on top of [`r2epub`](https://github.com/iherman/r2epub)). There was no real interest in the corresponding Bikeshed->EPUB transformation, i.e., there is no replacement for that.**_</span>

# respec2epub-book
A utility on top of respec2epub output for the creation of books containing several W3C TR-s

# Turn a *collection* of EPUB documents, produced via the respec2epub tool, into a single EPUB

This Python script is built upon the [respec2epub](https://github.com/iherman/respec2epub) utility. That tool can turn *individual* Respec based documents into a single EPUB documents. This tool combines
several EPUB documents generated by that utility *one* document. This utility is useful when a generic W3C technology consists of several, interrelated documents, each defining a Recommendation of a W3C Note.

The package is **not** a generic HTML➝EPUB 3 solution.

The package can be used through a command line tool (see the manual below) or can be the core of a separate Web Service.

The package relies on Python 2.7. The script does not work (yet?) with Python 3. Apart from the standard Python libraries the package depends on

* The [respec2epub](https://github.com/iherman/respec2epub). Note that this dependency is not only based on the fact that the layer takes the input generated by that output, but the some modules are also directly imported.
* [PyYAML](http://pyyaml.org/), the YAML parser, used for the configuration file (if YAML is used). Note that this module is important only if a YAML is found; if all configurations are strictly in JSON, the installation of this package is not necessary.

For further dependencies, inherited from the [respec2epub](https://github.com/iherman/respec2epub), see the [documentation in respec2epub](https://rawgit.com/iherman/respec2epub/master/Doc/build/html/index.html).

A [documentation in HTML](https://rawgit.com/iherman/respec2epub-book/master/Doc/build/html/index.html) is also available, giving more details. You can also download the [documentation in EPUB](https://github.com/iherman/respec2epub-book/blob/master/Doc/build/epub/respec2epub-collection.epub?raw=true).

## Installation

### End User

If you just want to use the package, the simplest is to run

```
pip install git+https://github.com/iherman/respec2epub-book.git
```

This will install the necessary modules and the command line tool. Its [manual page is online](https://rawgit.com/iherman/respec2epub-book/master/Doc/build/html/index.html)

### Developer

If you are a developer, you can clone the repository, install it from there, and off you go with your possible improvements

```
$ git clone  https://github.com/iherman/respec2epub-book.git
$ cd respec2epub-book
$ pip -e .  # this will run setup.py automatically
```

You can of course choose the "pedestrian" way to clone the repository and point your ``PYTHONPATH`` variable to the ``rp2book`` module. In that case you should install ``html5lib`` manually (see [the ``pypi`` entry for ``html5lib``](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/html5lib)), as well as ``respec2epub``

The documentation is in HTML, and can be started up locally in your browser pointing at ``PATHTOREPO/Doc/build/html/index.html``
